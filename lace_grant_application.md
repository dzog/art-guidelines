# Firefly Lace Grant

## Overview
The Firefly Arts Collective is proud to dedicate a significant portion of our annual budget towards grant programs for
art at our annual event in the woods and in Boston. This year we are offering the following programs:

* [Creativity Grant]()
* [Legacy Grant]()
* [Burner Exchange Grant]()
* [Lace Grant]()
* [Temple Grant]()

This application is for the Lace Grant.  This grant is to support projects of a larger and more ambitious scale than the
typical Creativity Grant project (hence the grant amount of $1000, rather than the Creativity Grant's maximum amount of
$700).  These projects not only serve as spectacles at Firefly, but also represent Firefly outside of our event at Open
Studios, FIGMENT Boston, and other similar events.  These projects must be appropriately large in scale, spectacular,
and suitable for presentation at a variety of venues.

## Review Criteria

Proposals will be evaluated based on the following factors:

* Thoughtfulness -- how well thought out is the project's relationship with participants?
* Creativity -- how original and awe-inspiring is your project?
* Feasibility -- how feasible is this project?

Lace Grant Applications will be considered for amounts up to $1000.00.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Application Submission Details
#### How do I submit my application?
*** Need to Answer ***

#### What does my application need to look like?
There's no standard format as long as you answer all of the required questions below!

* Remember the three criteria, and convince us that your project meets all three!  Make sure that the Review Committee
  can understand why your project is so awesome (and feasible!).

* Be as visual as possible.  Sometimes it's extremely difficult to tell exactly what awesome thing you're envisioning
  from text, and pictures go a long way towards making your vision clear.  Scanned pencil drawings, photographs, or CAD
  models are all helpful in conveying what you envision.

### Art Grant Contract Details

### Ticket Registration Details
#### Am I required to register for a ticket?
Yes!  *All* participants in the Firefly Arts Festival must register for a ticket.

#### If my grant proposal is accepted will I still have to pay for my ticket?
Yes! All participants are expected to pay for their ticket.

#### What if my project needs more than one person to execute it?  Will my entire group be guaranteed tickets to the event?
Each grant recipient will be allocated exactly one (1) ticket.  The ticket may be allocated to any individual on the grant team (not just the contact).

### Artist Meet-up Details
#### What is the Artist Meet-up?
As a part of Firefly Arts Collective's efforts to support artists, we will be holding two artist meet-ups in April and
June.  These meet-ups are a way for artists to meet each other, share ideas, and find solutions to issues they may be
having.  These provide informal situations for artists to get help from their peers and from Firefly Arts Collectives.

#### Do I need to bring anything?
Nope! Just yourself!  And maybe a dish if we decide to do it pot-luck style (details to be announced soon!).

### Open Studios Details
#### What is Open Studios?
For the past three years, Firefly Arts Collective have participated in Somerville Open Studios, providing a venue for
our artists to share their work with the city of Somerville.  This year we *require* all artists receiving Temple grants to
bring their projects to Firefly Open Studios.

#### What if my project isn't finished yet / doesn't fit in the space?
That's fine!  In Open Studio's own words, it's purpose "is to broaden the public's exposure to, and appreciation of,
finished works of art as well as the art-making process."  Bring your project in its semi-finished state and share the
process of making it with the community!  Bringing sketches, drawings, renderings, and prototypes is a welcome addition.

#### What if I live in a different state?
We'd love it if you made it to Open Studios (and will strongly encourage you to do so!), but we'll waive the
requirement to attend.

#### What if I have my own studio for Open Studios?
You are still required to bring your Firefly-funded project to Firefly Open Studios.  If you'd like, you can bring
unfunded works to Open Studios too!

### Firefly Details
#### What do I need to know about Firefly?
Check out the [Survival Guide](http://fireflyartscollective.org/firefly/survival-guide/) for everything you need to know
about Firefly Arts Festival.

#### Will Firefly provide assistance transporting art to the event?
Yes!  Firefly will assist in transporting all grant recipient projects to and from each required event.

#### When do projects need to be installed by?
All projects must be completed by Thursday of the event.  Failure to complete your project by this time may result in a withholding of the grant deposit.

#### What do you mean by Leave No Trace?
Firefly is a Leave No Trace event, meaning that we seek to minimally impact our environment.  Don't use materials like
sequins, feather, or styrofoam that break apart into pieces that are difficult to clean up.  Make sure that every single
part of your project comes back with you at the end of the event!

In addition to the material you bring with you, please remember to leave the environment as you found it!  This means
treating the trees well (don't cut them down or drill things into them!), filling up any holes that you create, and
generally taking good care of the land.

For more on Leave No Trace, read [Burning Man's LNT Guide](http://survival.burningman.com/leave-no-trace/)

### FIGMENT Boston Details
For details about FIGMENT Boston, please go read their [FAQ](http://boston.figmentproject.org/artist_faqs)

### Documentation Details
#### What sort of documentation do I need?
At minimum, 3 to 4 photos of your project.  These photos should verify that your project was completed, and was completed to meet the proposed project requirements.  For bonus points, submit video and/or audio recordings of your project!  We use this material not only to demonstrate that your grant was completed as documented, but as promotional material to showcase all of the great work produced by Fireflies.

## Application

Your application must answer each of the questions below to be considered for a Firefly Lace Grant.

### Artist Information
Please provide us with the following information on your application:
* Artist Name (or Collective Name)
* Name of Piece
* Contact Name
* Contact Postal Address
* Contact E-mail Address
* Contact Phone Number
* If you are awarded a Lace Grant, can we use your grant application as an example of a successful application next
  year?

### Grant Application

Please submit a .pdf file that addresses all of the following items:

#### Experience Design
Tell us about how your project.  We're most interested in the concept and how your project fits in with the rest of
Firefly.  Be sure to tell us how you expect people to interact with it -- is it visual? aural? tactile?

Please include any relevant drawings, sketches, images, or inspirations.

#### Technical Design
How will you actually build this? What sort of materials, hardware, tools, etc. will you need?  How will it be
constructed?  Please include relevant sketches and diagrams.

#### Installation Plan
Lace Grant projects provide logistical challenges beyond that of a normal Creativity Grant.  The project must be
exhibited not just at Firefly, but also at FIGMENT in the heart of Boston.  How do you plan on getting your project to
each site?  How do you plan on assembling it within a reasonable time frame at each event?  How will the project be
weatherproofed?


#### Risk Analysis
Safety of the project and participants is very important to us!  How do you plan to protect your project and participants from each other during both daylight and darkness?  Please include a detailed safety plan if the project has structural, combustible, or other major risk factors.  Some art (including flame effects and large-scale structures) may be subject to greater scrutiny and review by the Review Committee.

For further guidelines on safety and public art, please see Burning Man's page on [Creating Dangerous Art](http://www.burningman.com/installations/creating_dangerous_art.html)

#### Project Timeline
Attach (as a table) a rough timeline for your project.  We want to know that you've thought through how long this will
take to build.  Include the required dates included in the Summary of Deadlines.

#### Project Budget
Attach a separate table with an itemized budget that lists all of your expected expenses (including material costs,
equipment rentals, consumables, etc.)

Please also list a separate table showing how you plan to cover these costs -- what portion of the expenses will be
covered by the grant? How much from personal funds?

You may provide several proposed funding models, one for each grant tier you apply for.  Remember -- you can apply for
multiple funding tiers, but there is no partial funding.

#### Project Placement
Where would you like your project to be placed at Firefly?  Priority will be given to returning projects.

#### Leave No Trace Plan
Firefly is a Leave No Trace event (for more on what this means, see the FAQ above).  Please describe how your plan for
how your installation will Leave No Trace at our event.w
