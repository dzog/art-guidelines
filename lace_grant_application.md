# Firefly Lace Grant

## Overview
The Firefly Arts Collective is excited to offer a grant program for our annual event in the woods.  Each year, Firefly gives out three large-scale grants to ambitious projects that embody
our values.  These projects not only serve as participatory spectacles at Firefly, but also represent Firefly outside of the woods at
community experiences like Open Studios, FIGMENT Boston, and other similar events.  These projects must be appropriately large in scale, spectacular,
and suitable for presentation at a variety of venues.

## Review Criteria

Proposals will be evaluated based on the following factors:

* Thoughtfulness -- how well thought out is the project's relationship with participants?
* Creativity -- how original and awe-inspiring is your project?
* Feasibility -- how feasible is this project?

Lace Grant Applications will be considered for amounts up to $1000.00.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Application Submission Details

### Art Grant Contract Details
#### What's the significance of the "Lace" name?

### Ticket Registration Details

### Artist Meet-up Details
#### What is the Artist Meet-up?
As a part of Firefly Arts Collective's efforts to support artists, we will be holding two artist meet-ups in April and
June.  These meet-ups are a way for artists to meet each other, share ideas, and find solutions to issues they may be
having.  These provide informal situations for artists to get help from their peers and from Firefly Arts Collectives.

#### Do I need to bring anything?
Nope! Just yourself!  And maybe a dish if we decide to do it pot-luck style.

### Open Studios Details
#### What is Open Studios?
For the past three years, Firefly Arts Collective have participated in Somerville Open Studios, providing a venue for
our artists to share their work with the city of Somerville.  This year we *require* all artists receiving Temple grants to
bring their projects to Firefly Open Studios.

#### What if my project isn't finished yet / doesn't fit in the space?
That's fine!  In Open Studio's own words, it's purpose "is to broaden the public's exposure to, and appreciation of,
finished works of art as well as the art-making process."  Bring your project in its semi-finished state and share the
process of making it with the community!  Bringing sketches, drawings, renderings, and prototypes is a welcome addition.

#### What if I live in a different state?
We'd love it if you made it to Open Studios (and will strongly encourage you to do so!), but we'll waive the
requirement to attend.

#### What if I have my own studio for Open Studios?
You are still required to bring your Firefly-funded project to Firefly Open Studios.  If you'd like, you can bring
unfunded works to Open Studios too!

### Firefly Details
#### When do projects need to be installed by?
All projects must be completed by Thursday of the event.  Failure to complete your project by this time may result in a withholding of the grant deposit.

### FIGMENT Boston Details
For details about FIGMENT Boston, please go read their [FAQ](http://boston.figmentproject.org/artist_faqs)

### Documentation Details
#### What sort of documentation do I need?
At minimum, 3 - 4 photos of your project.  These photos should verify that your project was completed, and was completed to meet the proposed project requirements.  For bonus points, submit video and/or audio recordings of your project!  We use this material not only to demonstrate that your grant was completed as documented, but as promotional material to showcase all of the great work produced by Fireflies.

## Application

Your application must answer each of the questions below to be considered for a Firefly Lace Grant.

### Artist Information
Please provide us with the following information on your application:
* Artist Name (or Collective Name)
* Name of Piece
* Contact Name
* Contact Postal Address
* Contact E-mail Address
* Contact Phone Number
* If you are awarded a Lace Grant, can we use your grant application as an example of a successful application next
  year?

### Grant Application

Please submit a .pdf file that addresses all of the following items:

#### Experience Design
Tell us about your project.  Please include the concept, the scale, how people are to interact with it (is it visual?
aural? tactile?), and anything else relevant to the experience.  Please include any relevant drawings, sketches, images,
or inspirations.

#### Technical Design
How will you actually build this? What sort of materials, hardware, tools, etc. will you need?  How will it be
constructed?  Please include relevant sketches and diagrams.

#### Installation Plan
Lace Grant projects provide logistical challenges beyond that of a normal Creativity Grant.  The project must be exhibited not just at Firefly, but also at FIGMENT in the heart of Boston.  How do you plan on getting your project to each site?  How do you plan on assembling it within a reasonable time frame at each event?  How will the project be weatherproofed?

#### Risk Analysis
Safety of the project and participants is very important to us!  How do you plan to protect your project and participants from each other during both daylight and darkness?  Please include a detailed safety plan if the project has structural, combustible, or other major risk factors.  Some art (including flame effects and large-scale structures) may be subject to greater scrutiny and review by the Review Committee.

For further guidelines on safety and public art, please see Burning Man's page on [Creating Dangerous Art](http://www.burningman.com/installations/creating_dangerous_art.html)

#### Project Timeline
Attach (as a table) a rough timeline for your project.  We want to know that you've thought through how long this will
take to build.  Include the required dates included in the Summary of Deadlines.

#### Project Budget
Attach a separate table with an itemized budget that lists all of your expected expenses (including material costs,
equipment rentals, consumables, etc.)

Please also list a separate table showing how you plan to cover these costs -- what portion of the expenses will be
covered by the grant? How much from personal funds?

You may provide several proposed funding models, one for each grant tier you apply for.  Remember -- you can apply for
multiple funding tiers, but there is no partial funding.

#### Project Placement
Where would you like your project to be placed at Firefly?  Priority will be given to returning projects.

#### Leave No Trace Plan
Please describe your LNT Plan.
