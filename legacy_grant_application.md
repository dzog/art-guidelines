# Firefly Legacy Grant

## Overview
The Firefly Arts Collective is excited to offer a grant program for our annual event in the woods.  The Legacy
Grant is provided to support existing projects. Art can be exposed to many elements at Firefly -- mud, rain, sun, and
most of all, people -- and this grant is designed to provide funding to help with wear and tear produced by this exposure.

## Review Criteria

Proposals will be evaluated based on the following factors:

* Thoughtfulness -- how well thought out is the project's relationship with participants?
* Creativity -- how original and awe-inspiring is your project?
* Need -- What does the project need additionally funding for?

Legacy Grants are currently available for $100.

### Grant Application

Please submit a .pdf file that addresses all of the following items:

#### Experience Design
Not all of us have seen your project before!  Tell us about your project.  Please include the concept, the scale, how people are to interact with it (is it visual?
aural? tactile?), and anything else relevant to the experience.  Please include any relevant drawings, sketches, images,
or inspirations.

#### Technical Design
How will you actually build this? What sort of materials, hardware, tools, etc. will you need?  How will it be
constructed?  What changes do you intend to make with Legacy Grant funding?  Please include relevant sketches and diagrams.

#### Installation Plan
How will you get your project to its placed site? How will you weatherproof it? How will you make sure you complete it
before Thursday? Convince us that you can make this project happen in the middle of the Vermont woods in July.

#### Risk Analysis
*How do we rephrase this?*
Please perform a risk analysis. What safeguards do you have in place? How do you plan to protect the project or
participants during the day or night and from the projectâ€™s correct function or error? What are the potential health
hazards or danger to the environment? Please include a detailed safety plan if the project requires structural,
combustible, or other qualities of risk.Some large-scale art, or projects utilizing fire, for example, may be subject to
greater scrutiny/further questions from the Art Grant Review Committee. ANY Art that incorporates fire MUSTbe reviewed
by the Fire Core. For further ideas about safety of public art, please see:
http://www.burningman.com/installations/creating_dangerous_art.html

#### Project Timeline
Attach (as a table) a rough timeline for your project.  We want to know that you've thought through how long this will
take to build.  Include the required dates included in the Summary of Deadlines.

#### Project Budget
Attach a separate table with an itemized budget that lists all of your new expenses.

Please also list a separate table showing how you plan to cover these costs -- what portion of the expenses will be
covered by the grant? How much from personal funds?

#### Project Placement
Where would you like your project to be placed?  Priority will be given to returning projects.

#### Leave No Trace Plan
Please describe your LNT Plan.
