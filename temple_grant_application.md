# Firefly Temple Grant

## Overview
The Firefly Arts Collective is excited to offer a grant program for our annual event in the woods.  The Temple aims to
satisfy both a civic and spiritual need by creating a sacred space for gathering at Firefly.  The Temple is placed in
the field, and provides a space for Fireflies to seek quiet contemplation and introspection at the event.  It is of the
utmost importance that the the Temple defines a physical (and emotional) space; that said, it does not have to be traditional shelter or
building.

It is traditional for the temple to serve as a place for participants to leave offerings, and the structure will be
burned on Saturday night of the event.

## Review Criteria

Proposals will be evaluated based on the following factors:

* Thoughtfulness -- how well thought out is the project's relationship with participants?
* Creativity -- how original and awe-inspiring is your project?
* Feasibility -- how feasible is this project?

Temple Grant Applications will be considered for amounts up to $1000.00.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Application Submission Details

### Art Grant Contract Details
#### Something about setting up the temple by the last work weekend.

### Ticket Registration Details
#### Am I required to register for a ticket?

#### If my grant proposal is accepted will I still have to pay for my ticket?

#### What if my project needs more than one person to execute it?  Will my entire group be guaranteed tickets to the event?


### Artist Meetup Details
#### What is the Artist Meetup?
As a part of Firefly Arts Collective's efforts to support artists, we will be holding two artist meetups in April and
June.  These meetups are a way for artists to meet each other, share ideas, and find solutions to issues they may be
having.  These provide informal situations for artists to get help from their peers and from Firefly Arts Collectives.

#### Do I need to bring anything?
Nope! Just yourself!  And maybe a dish if we decide to do it pot-luck style.

### Open Studios Details
#### What is Open Studios?
For the past three years, Firefly Arts Collective have participated in Somerville Open Studios, providing a venue for
our artists to share their work with the city of Somerville.  This year we *require* all artists receiving Temple grants to
bring their projects to Firefly Open Studios.

#### What if my project isn't finished yet / doesn't fit in the space?
That's fine!  In Open Studio's own words, it's purpose "is to broaden the public's exposure to, and appreciation of,
finished works of art as well as the art-making process."  Bring your project in its semi-finished state and share the
process of making it with the community!  Bringing sketches, drawings, renderings, and prototypes is a welcome addition.

#### What if I live in a different state?
We'd love it if you made it to Open Studios (and will strongly encourage you to do so!), but we'll waive the
requirement to attend.

#### What if I have my own studio for Open Studios?
You are still required to bring your Firefly-funded project to Firefly Open Studios.  If you'd like, you can bring
unfunded works to Open Studios too!

### Firefly Details

#### Will Firefly provide assistance transporting art to the event?

#### When do projects need to be installed by?
All projects must be completed by Thursday of the event.  Failure to complete your project by this time may result in a withholding of the grant deposit.

### Documentation Details
#### What sort of documentation do I need?
At minimum, 3 - 4 photos of your project.  These photos should verify that your project was completed, and was completed to meet the proposed project requirements.  For bonus points, submit video and/or audio recordings of your project!  We use this material not only to demonstrate that your grant was completed as documented, but as promotional material to showcase all of the great work produced by Fireflies.

### Grant Application

Please submit a .pdf file that addresses all of the following items:

#### Experience Design
Tell us about your project.  Please include the concept, the scale, how people are to interact with it (is it visual?
aural? tactile?), and anything else relevant to the experience.  Please include any relevant drawings, sketches, images,
or inspirations.

#### Technical Design
How will you actually build this? What sort of materials, hardware, tools, etc. will you need?  How will it be
constructed?  Please include relevants sketches and diagrams.

#### Installation Plan
How will you get your project to its placed site? How will you weatherproof it? How will you make sure you complete it
before the event begins? Keep in mind that the Temple is typically built during work weekends, and the majority of construction is completed before the event.

#### Risk Analysis
Safety of the project and participants is very important to us!  How do you plan to protect your project and participants from each other during both daylight and darkness?  Please include a detailed safety plan if the project has structural, combustible, or other major risk factors.  Some art (including flame effects and large-scale structures) may be subject to greater scrutiny and review by the Review Committee.

For further guidelines on safety and public art, please see Burning Man's page on [Creating Dangerous Art](http://www.burningman.com/installations/creating_dangerous_art.html)

#### Project Timeline
Attach (as a table) a rough timeline for your project.  We want to know that you've thought through how long this will
take to build.  Include the required dates included in the Summary of Deadlines.

#### Project Budget
Attach a seperate table with an itemized budget that lists all of your expected expenses (including material costs,
equipment rentals, consumables, etc.)

Please also list a separate table showing how you plan to cover these costs -- what portion of the expenses will be
covered by the grant? How much from personal funds?

#### Leave No Trace Plan
Please describe your LNT Plan.
