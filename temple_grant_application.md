# Firefly Temple Grant

## Overview
The Firefly Arts Collective, (FAC), is excited to offer a grant program for our annual event in the woods.  The Temple aims to satisfy both a civic and spiritual need by creating a sacred space for gathering at Firefly.  The Temple is placed in the field, and provides a space for Fireflies to seek quiet contemplation and introspection at the event.  It is of the utmost importance that the The Temple defines a space; that said, it does not have to be traditional shelter or building.

It is traditional for the temple to serve as a place for participants to leave offerings, and the structure will be burned on Saturday night of the event.  

### Review Criteria

Proposals will be evaluated based on the following factors:

* Thoughtfulness -- how well thought out is the project's relationship with participants?
* Creativity -- how original and awe-inspiring is your project?
* Feasibility -- how feasible is this project?

Temple Grant Applications will be considered for amounts up to $1000.00.
