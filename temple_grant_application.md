# Firefly Temple Grant

## Overview
The Firefly Arts Collective is proud to dedicate a significant portion of our annual budget towards grant programs for
art at our annual event in the woods and in Boston. This year we are offering the following programs:

* [Creativity Grant]()
* [Legacy Grant]()
* [Burner Exchange Grant]()
* [Lace Grant]()
* [Temple Grant]()

This application is for the Temple Grants.  The Temple aims to satisfy both civic and spiritual needs by creating a
sacred gathering space at Firefly.  The Temple is placed in the field, and provides a space for Fireflies to seek quiet
contemplation and introspection at the event.  It is of the utmost importance that the Temple defines a physical (and
emotional) space; that said, it does not have to be a traditional shelter or building.

It is traditional for the Temple to serve as a place for participants to leave offerings, and the structure will be
burned on the Saturday night of the event.

## Review Criteria

Proposals will be evaluated based on the following factors:

* Thoughtfulness -- how well thought out is the project's relationship with participants?
* Creativity -- how original and awe-inspiring is your project?
* Feasibility -- how feasible is this project?

Temple Grant Applications will be considered for amounts up to $1000.00.

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### How do I submit my application?
*** Need to Answer ***

#### What does my application need to look like?
There's no standard format as long as you answer all of the required questions below!

* Remember the three criteria, and convince us that your project meets all three!  Make sure that the Review Committee
  can understand why your project is so awesome (and feasible!).

* Be as visual as possible.  Sometimes it's extremely difficult to tell exactly what awesome thing you're envisioning
  from text, and pictures go a long way towards making your vision clear.  Scanned pencil drawings, photographs, or CAD
  models are all helpful in conveying what you envision.

### Art Grant Contract Details

### Ticket Registration Details
#### Am I required to register for a ticket?
Yes!  *All* participants in the Firefly Arts Festival must register for a ticket.

#### If my grant proposal is accepted will I still have to pay for my ticket?
Yes! All participants are expected to pay for their ticket.

#### What if my project needs more than one person to execute it?  Will my entire group be guaranteed tickets to the event?
Each grant recipient will be allocated exactly one (1) ticket.  The ticket may be allocated to any individual on the grant team (not just the contact).

### Artist Meet-up Details
#### What is the Artist Meet-up?
As a part of Firefly Arts Collective's efforts to support artists, we will be holding two artist meet-ups in April and
June.  These meet-ups are a way for artists to meet each other, share ideas, and find solutions to issues they may be
having.  These provide informal situations for artists to get help from their peers and from Firefly Arts Collectives.

#### Do I need to bring anything?
Nope! Just yourself!  And maybe a dish if we decide to do it pot-luck style (details to be announced soon!).

### Open Studios Details
#### What is Open Studios?
For the past three years, Firefly Arts Collective have participated in Somerville Open Studios, providing a venue for
our artists to share their work with the city of Somerville.  This year we *require* all artists receiving Temple grants to
bring their projects to Firefly Open Studios.

#### What if my project isn't finished yet / doesn't fit in the space?
That's fine!  In Open Studio's own words, it's purpose "is to broaden the public's exposure to, and appreciation of,
finished works of art as well as the art-making process."  Bring your project in its semi-finished state and share the
process of making it with the community!  Bringing sketches, drawings, renderings, and prototypes is a welcome addition.

#### What if I live in a different state?
We'd love it if you made it to Open Studios (and will strongly encourage you to do so!), but we'll waive the
requirement to attend.

#### What if I have my own studio for Open Studios?
You are still required to bring your Firefly-funded project to Firefly Open Studios.  If you'd like, you can bring
unfunded works to Open Studios too!

### Firefly Details
#### What do I need to know about Firefly?
Check out the [Survival Guide](http://fireflyartscollective.org/firefly/survival-guide/) for everything you need to know
about Firefly Arts Festival.

#### Will Firefly provide assistance transporting art to the event?
Yes!  Firefly will assist in transporting all grant recipient projects to and from each required event.

#### When do projects need to be installed by?
All projects must be completed by Thursday of the event.  Failure to complete your project by this time may result in a withholding of the grant deposit.

#### What do you mean by Leave No Trace?
Firefly is a Leave No Trace event, meaning that we seek to minimally impact our environment.  Don't use materials like
sequins, feather, or styrofoam that break apart into pieces that are difficult to clean up.  Make sure that every single
part of your project comes back with you at the end of the event!

In addition to the material you bring with you, please remember to leave the environment as you found it!  This means
treating the trees well (don't cut them down or drill things into them!), filling up any holes that you create, and
generally taking good care of the land.

## Application

Your application must answer each of the questions below to be considered for a Firefly Lace Grant.

### Artist Information
Please provide us with the following information on your application:
* Artist Name (or Collective Name)
* Name of Piece
* Contact Name
* Contact Postal Address
* Contact E-mail Address
* Contact Phone Number
* If you are awarded a Temple Grant, can we use your grant application as an example of a successful application next
  year?

### Grant Application

Please submit a .pdf file that addresses all of the following items:

#### Experience Design
Tell us about how your project.  We're most interested in the concept and how your project fits in with the rest of
Firefly.  Be sure to tell us how you expect people to interact with it -- is it visual? aural? tactile?

Please include any relevant drawings, sketches, images, or inspirations.

#### Technical Design
How will you actually build this? What sort of materials, hardware, tools, etc. will you need?  How will it be
constructed?  Keep in mind that the entire structure will be burned, so that should influence your choice of materials.

Please include relevant sketches and diagrams.

#### Installation Plan
The Temple provides logistical challenges beyond that of a normal Creativity Grant.  Temples are usually much larger
scale than typical projects, and must be built entirely of wood (so that it burns!).  Many previous temple builders
have utilized work weekends to complete the temple.

Please tell us about your plan for constructing the temple on site.

#### Risk Analysis
Safety of the project and participants is very important to us!  How do you plan to protect your project and participants from each other during both daylight and darkness?  Please include a detailed safety plan if the project has structural, combustible, or other major risk factors.  Some art (including flame effects and large-scale structures) may be subject to greater scrutiny and review by the Review Committee.

For further guidelines on safety and public art, please see Burning Man's page on [Creating Dangerous Art](http://www.burningman.com/installations/creating_dangerous_art.html)

#### Project Timeline
Attach (as a table) a rough timeline for your project.  We want to know that you've thought through how long this will
take to build.  Include the required dates included in the Summary of Deadlines.

#### Project Budget
Attach a separate table with an itemized budget that lists all of your expected expenses (including material costs,
equipment rentals, consumables, etc.)

Please also list a separate table showing how you plan to cover these costs -- what portion of the expenses will be
covered by the grant? How much from personal funds?

You may provide several proposed funding models, one for each grant tier you apply for.  Remember -- you can apply for
multiple funding tiers, but there is no partial funding.

#### Leave No Trace Plan
Firefly is a Leave No Trace event (for more on what this means, see the FAQ above).  Please describe how your plan for
how your installation will Leave No Trace at our event.w
