# Art Core Grant Review Process

This document contains all of the process and procedures for reviewing art grants.

## Grant Submissions

All grants shall be submitted via the Submissions Website. The website automatically anonymizes the documents
while providing the Review Committee access to them in .pdf format.


## Review Committee

### Call for Committee Members
The call for committee members will be sent out no later than the first art grant announcement; preferably at least two
weeks before the first announcement.  The Review Committee will have an odd number of members, being no less than 7
people but no more than 11.

The Art Core Leads and Board Liason may be members of the Review Committee, but are not
required to be.  Members of the Review Committee may apply for a grant, but may not discuss that grant at either of the
Review Committee meetings.

### Initial Review
Each member of the Review Committee will review all applications and assign them a numerical score of 0, 1, or 2 on each
of the three Review Criteria (Thoughtfullness, Creativity, and Feasibility) before the first meeting.  These scores
maybe revised until the day after the Selection Meeting.

During Initial Review, each Reviewer may submit questions for the applicant to answer on the Submissions Website.  Both
the question and corresponding answer will be visible to all other Reviewers.

### Committee Meeting
All voting members of the Review Committee are required to attend the Committee Meeting; absence at this meeting will
results in their Review Account being deactivated and their vote nullified.

Projects will be reviewed with a fixed time limit on discussion for each project (suggested: 5 minutes).  Only projects
with an Initial Review Score of 0.75 or higher will be considered for group discussion, and will be reviewed in
descending order of Inital Review Score.  The time at the meeting is to be used for group discussion, and to pose any
questions about the application.  All unanswered questions will be forwarded to the applicant to be answered before the
Selection Meeting.

### Selection Meeting
The Selection Meeting will be held one week after the Committee Meeting.  All voting members are again required to
attend the Selection Meeting; absence from this meeting will results in a nullified vote and deactivation of the
member's Review Account.

The Selection Meeting will be used to answer all outstanding questions regarding applications, as well as providing
another venue for further discussion.  Review Committee Members will have 24 hours after this meeting to finalize their
scores before final selections are made.

### Notification
All artists will be notified of the outcome of their application no later than three days after the Review Committee has
made their selections.
