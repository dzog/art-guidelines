# Firefly Creativity Grant

## Overview
The Firefly Arts Collective, (FAC), is excited to offer a grant program for our annual event in the woods. These grant awards are intended to support and promote your interactive, community-based, collaborative, radically-expressive creations. Proposals can include installations, performances, 2-D and 3-D works, fire art, activities, or other participatory and interactive projects. Only projects that meet these criteria should be submitted. For example, a sound project (band, DJ, etc.) must include an interactive component or additional performance aspect to be considered. Individual theme camps will not be funded, but proposals for projects/events placed within Theme Camp areas are welcome to apply.

### Review Criteria

Proposals will be evaluated based on the following factors:

* Relationship between piece and participants
* Originality and Creativity
* Feasibility (including capabilities of the artist)

Grants are currently available at the following tiers:

* $100
* $300
* $500
* $800

Please indicate which tier you are applying for in your grant application (you may apply for multiple tiers!).  Unlike previous years, there is no partial funding model this year.

### Grant Application

Please submit a .pdf file that addresses all of the following items:

#### Experience Design
Tell us about your project.  Please include the concept, the scale, how people are to interact with it (is it visual? aural? tactile?), and anything else relevant to the experience.  Please include any relevant drawings, sketches, images, or inspirations.

#### Technical Design
How will you actually build this? What sort of materials, hardware, tools, etc. will you need?  How will it be constructed?  Please include relevants sketches and diagrams.

#### Installation Plan
How will you get it up the hill? How will you weatherproof it? How will you make sure you complete it before Thursday? Convince us that you can make this project happen in the middle of the Vermont woods in July.

#### Risk Analysis
Do we need this still?

#### Project Timeline
Attach (as a table) a rough timeline for your project.  We want to know that you've thought through how long this will take to build.  Include the required dates included in the Summary of Deadlines.

#### Project Budget
Attach a seperate table with an itemized budget that lists all of your expected expenses (including material costs, equipment rentals, consumables, etc.)

Please also list a separate table showing how you plan to cover these costs -- what portion of the expenses will be covered by the grant? How much from personal funds?

You may provide several proposed funding models, one for each grant tier you apply for.  Remember -- you can apply for multiple funding tiers, but there is no partial funding.

#### Project Placement
Where would you like your project to be placed?  Priority will be given to returning projects.

Please describe your LNT Plan.
