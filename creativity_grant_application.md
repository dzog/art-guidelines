# Firefly Creativity Grant

## Overview
The Firefly Arts Collective, (FAC), is excited to offer a grant program for our annual event in the woods. These grant awards are intended to support and promote your interactive, community-based, collaborative, radically-expressive creations. Proposals can include installations, performances, 2-D and 3-D works, fire art, activities, or other participatory and interactive projects. Only projects that meet these criteria should be submitted. For example, a sound project (band, DJ, etc.) must include an interactive component or additional performance aspect to be considered. Individual theme camps will not be funded, but proposals for projects/events placed within Theme Camp areas are welcome to apply.

### Review Criteria

Proposals will be evaluated based on the following factors:

* Relationship between piece and participants
