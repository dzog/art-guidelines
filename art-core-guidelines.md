## Grant Process

The grant process will take place via a Firefly Art Grant web portal (to be developed).

All applications will be submitted via a standardized web form and reviewed via a reviewers section on the site.

### Art Grant Application

Below are general thoughts on each of the questions.

- Project Overview

NSL: I think this should be separated into two section -- an 'experience' section, meant to explain to the committee how the artist envisions particpants experiencing their work; and a 'schematic' type section, where the applicant descirbes how they'll actually build it.

- Interactivity

NSL: I'd rather wrap this into the 'experience' section; I feel that requiring (rather than having preference for) interactivity gives a lot of janky interactions.  Honestly, I'd rather fund a really awesome non-interactive project than a janky interactive project that's only interactive so they can get money.


- Placement Requirements

NSL: Fine as-is.


- Risk Analysis

NSL: Fine as-is.


- Rain Plan

NSL: Should be wrapped up with installation plan.


- Project Schedule

NSL:


- Installation Plan

NSL: Needs a bit over an overhaul.  Concerns include: How does the project package up to be transportable? How do you intend to get it on-site? How many people do you need to carry it up the hill? How do you plan to make sure it survives the weather?


- Supporting documents

NSL: Fine as-is.


- Cost and Budget

NSL: Perhaps we should make it more clear that we expect Fireflies to pay for some amount of their project; art grants are meant to help projects go further, not to entirely fund them.


- ~~Partial Funding~~

NSL: I think we're removing this?


- Leave No Trace Plan

NSL: fine as-is.


- Documentation

NSL: Should we remove this? This isn't really a question as much as a reminder... everyone just answers "I'll take photos/video".

## Artist Support

## Grants

Applicants may apply for multiple grants in the same year; however, each project is only eligible for a single grant.  In addition, all grants are all-or-nothing 	- there is no partial funding model.

Grants are intended to support a project's completion - not to fund it in full.

### Creativity Grants

Creativity Grants are the basic grant that Firefly gives out for its summer festival.  Applicants may apply for one of four budget tiers with their project:

- $100
- $300
- $500
- $700

All creativity grants are required to be present for both Firefly Arts Festival and at Firefly Open Studios.  Projects need not be complete at open studios, but the artist must be present if at all possible.


### Legacy Grants

Returning projects may apply for a Legacy Grant.  Legacy Grants are meant for projects that are returning, and only need minor funding for repairs, upgrades, etc.  Projects that are undergoing a large overhaul must either be self-funded or apply for a creativity grant.  The Legacy Grant offers a returning project a grant for $100 or less to improve upon a previous grant.


### Silk Grants

Silk Grants are multi-event grants.  These are for NEW projects (not currently existing projects).  Projects must be spectacular, and be present at both Firefly Arts Festival and FIGMENT Boston.  Silk Grants are eligible for up to $1000.00 of funding.

### Temple Grant

Art Core also runs the process for selecting the temple each year.
