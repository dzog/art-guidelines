## Grant Process

The grant process will take place via a Firefly Art Grant web portal (to be developed).

All applications will be submitted via a standardized web form and reviewed via a reviewers section on the site.

### Applicants
Each grant application should serve as a complete set of instructions for how each grant is handled.

### Reviewers
review-process.md contains all information about the Review Committee Process used to select art grants.

### Core Leads
This document should contain everything that the core leads need to know!

## Artist Support


## Grants

Applicants may apply for multiple grants in the same year; however, each project is only eligible for a single grant.  In addition, all grants are all-or-nothing 	- there is no partial funding model.

Grants are intended to support a project's completion - not to fund it in full.

### Creativity Grants

Creativity Grants are the basic grant that Firefly gives out for its summer festival.  Applicants may apply for one of four budget tiers with their project:

- $100
- $300
- $500
- $700

All creativity grants are required to be present for both Firefly Arts Festival and at Firefly Open Studios.  Projects need not be complete at open studios, but the artist must be present if at all possible.

### Legacy Grants

Returning projects may apply for a Legacy Grant.  Legacy Grants are meant for projects that are returning, and only need minor funding for repairs, upgrades, etc.  Projects that are undergoing a large overhaul must either be self-funded or apply for a creativity grant.  The Legacy Grant offers a returning project a grant for $100 or less to improve upon a previous grant.

### Lace Grants

Lace Grants are multi-event grants.  These are for NEW projects (not currently existing projects).  Projects must be spectacular, and be present at both Firefly Arts Festival and FIGMENT Boston.  Lace Grants are eligible for up to $1000.00 of funding.

### Temple Grant

Art Core also runs the process for selecting the temple each year.
