## Grant Process

This will be the website.  Not sure what else to add.

## Grants

Applicants may apply for multiple grants in the same year; however, each project is only eligible for a single grant.  In addition, all grants are all-or-nothing 	- there is no partial funding model.

### Creativity Grants

Creativity Grants are the basic grant that Firefly gives out for its summer festival.  Applicants may apply for one of four budget tiers with their project:

- $100
- $300
- $500
- $700

All creativity grants are required to be present for both Firefly Arts Festival and at Firefly Open Studios.  Projects need not be complete at open studios, but the artist must be present if at all possible.

### Legacy Grants

Returning projects may apply for a Legacy Grant.  Legacy Grants are meant for projects that are returning, and only need minor funding for repairs, upgrades, etc.  Projects that are undergoing a large overhaul must either be self-funded or apply for a creativity grant.  The Legacy Grant offers a returning project a grant for $100 or less to improve upon a previous grant.  

### Silk Grants

Silk Grants are multi-event grants.  These are for NEW projects (not currently existing projects).  Projects must be spectacular, and be present at both Firefly Arts Festival and FIGMENT Boston.  Silk Grants are eligible for up to $1000.00 of funding.

### Temple Grant

Art Core also runs the process for selecting the temple each year.  *We need more information before we can write guidelines for this*
